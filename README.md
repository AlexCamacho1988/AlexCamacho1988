## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Alejandro Camacho

I'm passionate about data and its power to tell stories, uncover opportunities, and support strategic decision-making. I trained as a Data Analyst and earned my degree in Electronics Engineer, developing skills in handling large datasets, data visualization, and statistical modeling.

I enjoy staying constantly up to date and recently completed a tech bootcamp at TripleTen, where I was able to put my knowledge with tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau, and gained experience cleaning, transforming, and analyzing real-world data to solve practical problems. I also have a solid understanding of statistics, programming logic, and relational databases.

I'm always learning and looking for opportunities to apply my skills in projects that make a real impact. I'm motivated by teamwork, challenges, and continuous growth within the data analysis field.
